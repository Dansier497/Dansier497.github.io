I'm a PhD candidate with the economics department at the University of Ottawa. I'm an applied microeconomist and my research interests are law and economics, the economics of crime, and terrorism.

I'm a dog person. My hobbies include board games, Dungeons & Dragons, camping, Magic the Gathering, jazz guitar, mechanical keyboards, reading sci-fi and fantasy, and yelling about the Toronto Maple Leafs.
