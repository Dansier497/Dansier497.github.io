<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">In her Ely lecture at the AEAs, Nobel laureate Esther Duflo once famously said economists need a plumber mindset as we increasingly help governments design policies and even regulations and must engage with the details. ðŸ§µ<a href="https://t.co/M8VlmZcreZ">https://t.co/M8VlmZcreZ</a></p>&mdash; Kweku Opoku-Agyemang, Ph.D (@KwekuOA) <a href="https://twitter.com/KwekuOA/status/1638986976182378496?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 23, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Opoku-Agyemang then goes on to say...

[Banerjee](https://www.bostonreview.net/articles/inside-the-machine/) writes, "The great virtue of the recent emphasis on randomized evaluations of social programs, it seems to me, is that they force us to venture inside the machine."

I like this, and take it really to follow hand-in-hand with the credibility revolution.

Institutional details matter because mechanisms matter and treatment design matters, and heterogeneous treatment effects matter. Go on...

Institutional details are often found on the ground, where traditionally economists are not found. However, other disciplines do and increasingly, wi th the rise of field experiments especially in development, economists are finding their way there.

However, other sub fields have limited contact with the subjects/objects/observations of their research. Combined with the general trend of economists lack of reading and/or citation of other fields, we are missing many of these details.

I take the economist as plumber as a veiled call to engage more seriously across disciplines and even perhaps the adoption of mixed methods approaches to provide better justification of mechanisms and instrument/construct validity.

Political science as an example, Chris Blattman, etc.
