Feel familiar?

I'm working on putting together a reading group during the 2021 summer (start options are April, May, or June) to dig into the many papers pushing forward difference-in-differences, two-way fixed-effects estimators, and event study research methods.

If you're anything like me then you've got a folder with a bunch of these papers in it but haven't gotten around to digging into them yet. Maybe you've been pointed to them (or have done the pointing) in referee reports. I figured that there was probably a bunch of people in the same boat and the idea of the reading group came about.

[Here's a survey for anyone interested](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc0zfWA-B2dd50SXOvHJ6GFuJXIlRLR6y3LVXMqxUDh1ZZj9w/viewform?usp=sf_link)

[And I've set up a Slack for planning and developing the reading list and schedule](https://join.slack.com/t/didreadinggroup/shared_invite/zt-n72wc6e8-~5vrAKiuMj32Sn1czaTJPg)


###Other Resources
Christine Cai has an awesome resource that we'll likely be using heavily to decide which papers to cover: [https://christinecai.github.io/PublicGoods/applied_micro_methods.pdf](https://christinecai.github.io/PublicGoods/applied_micro_methods.pdf)

Chloe East has a similar series of virtual brownbags that you should also check out: [https://www.chloeneast.com/metrics-discussions.html](https://www.chloeneast.com/metrics-discussions.html)

Here's a twitter thread that has slides form some of the authors of these papers, another great resource for presenters in the reading group!
