I am a PhD candidate with the economics department at the University of Ottawa. I am an applied microeconomist and my research interests broadly fall under political economy, public economics, and law and economics. ~~I will be visiting Universitat Pompeu Fabra in Spring 2020.~~

I like coffee, Dungeons & Dragons, and grumbling about the Toronto Maple Leafs.
