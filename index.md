I am a second-year PhD student in the Department of Economics at Florida State University. 

My primary research interests are time series analysis, health economics, and environmental economics. 

Before beginning my PhD, I attended the University of North Carolina at Wilmington where I received a double major in Political Science (BA) and Business Administration with a concentration in Economics (BS) in 2022. I received a M.S. (2023) in Economics at Florida State University.
