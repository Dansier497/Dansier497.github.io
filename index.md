I'm a PhD candidate with the economics department at the University of Ottawa. In summer 2022, I will join Brock University as an Assistant Professor. 

I am an applied microeconomist with research interests in law, health, and public economics. 

I like coffee, Dungeons & Dragons, and grumbling about the Toronto Maple Leafs.
